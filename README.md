This is the inbound scanning project for King Ace Hardware, written by TJ King. 
This is my first git repository. I'm also learning Linux and vim, all kind of at the same time.

Our current point-of-sale software does not have an inbound scanning feature,
and with the current amount of strain at the warehouse (covid-19 related), we don't
fully trust ACE's accuracy. This project allows us to verify receipt of items ordered.
It will tell us if we received less or more of an item than we expected. However,
it will not tell us if we receive an unexpected item.
